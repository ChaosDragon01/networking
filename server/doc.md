# Documentation for Server 

The server folder contains all the important files needed to run this local messaging web application server. 

# main file is server.py

the server is contained in the server.py file

the user interface is created inthe templates folder and the static folder. Make sure none of those folders are tampered with if the server.py code is not modified relative to the change in static and templates folder

when loading the server there will be multiple given addresses to access the server. However to my tests, Only one of them works
if you run it test for each address to see which one of your address it works

            # Login: 
                Logging in without an user-id is impossible 



# testserver.py 

this file most likely won't work beyond opening a port anymore since the file wasn't updated since the html file and it's styles and css were seperated along side that databases were changed and localized
