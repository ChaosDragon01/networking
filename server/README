# Documentation for Server 

The server folder contains all the important files needed to run this local messaging web application server. 

# main file is server.py

the server is contained in the server.py file

the user interface is created inthe templates folder and the static folder. Make sure none of those folders are tampered with if the server.py code is not modified relative to the change in static and templates folder

when loading the server there will be multiple given addresses to access the server. However to my tests, Only one of them works
